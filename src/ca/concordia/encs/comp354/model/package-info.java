* 
* This is the package level documentation for the {@link ca.concordia.encs.comp354.model} package.
* 
* It is part of the MVC design pattern used to implement the Codenames board game.
* 
* This is done by incorporating the logic and control flow classes from the {@link ca.concordia.encs.comp354.controller} package
* and the {@link ca.concordia.encs.comp354.view} package that handles the visualization of data through the game.
* 
* The function of the classes in this package is to maintain the integrity and fundamental attributes of game objects. 
* 
* These classes will have some logic to update the controller package  classes if their data changes.
* 
* This allows for a higher degree of encapsulation as it keeps the model and
* view packages separate from each other.
